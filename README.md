### Plan
- Ryan looking at the base case (300K), examining the LW & SW flux convergence (top-bottom) for clear sky and all sky, and investigating how these radiative features impact the precipitation
- Greg looking at the 'first derivatives' of properties (max cloud fraction, height and how these vary with SSTs), as well as the first derivatives of all the radiative features that Ryan has computed
  - Look at second derivative quantities (e.g. hydrologic sensitivity vs SST change) if time permits
- Marius looking at the hydrologic sensitivity, maybe further examine precipitation efficiency accross models (large spread)
